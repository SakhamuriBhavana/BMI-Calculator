# BMI-Calculator
BMI is a measure that uses a person’s weight and height to assess whether their weight is within a healthy range. The formula for BMI is:-
BMI= weight(kg)/height(m)^2
Steps to Create a BMI Calculator
1.Input Gathering: Prompt the user to input their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters).
2.BMI Calculation: Use the BMI formula to compute the value.
3.Categorization: Based on the BMI value, categorize the result into underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese using standard BMI ranges:
4.Underweight: BMI < 18.5
5.Normal weight: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9
6.Overweight: 25 ≤ BMI < 29.9
7.Obese: BMI ≥ 30
8.Output Results: Display the BMI value and the corresponding category.
